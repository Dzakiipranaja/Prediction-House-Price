Property Price Prediction

This project is a simple tool to predict house prices in the Dumbo area using Linear Regression. It shows how the size of a house (in square feet) affects its selling price.

📊 Project Overview
The project follows these steps:

Load Data: Reading house information from a CSV file.

Visualize: Creating a scatter plot to see the relationship between size and price.

Train Model: Using the scikit-learn library to train a Linear Regression model.

Predict: Testing the model to see how accurately it predicts prices for new data.

Results: Showing a red regression line over the actual data points.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python: The programming language.

Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and math.

Matplotlib: For drawing the charts.

Scikit-Learn: For the Machine Learning model.
